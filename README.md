# reLinkR

reLinkR is an URL shortener which was originally created for replacing Bit.ly and a bunch of Python scripts in my social media workflow. 

The project has got two parts. [`relinkr-api`](relinkr-api) is the back-end, which provides REST endpoints and it's based on Spring Boot. While [`relinkr-ui`](relinkr-ui) is an SPA based on VueJS and Bootstrap.
